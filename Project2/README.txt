Summary: Using Flex for lexical analysis to create tokens to be parsed in by bison to create a syntax tree. 
         The syntax tree is defined by sets of rules provided inside myparser.y 
         Bison compiles but the syntax BNF is still under devolpment
         Extra error: handling were included in my regex rules. For example, 'cc' will result in Multichar error and 'c will result in unterminated char
         Extra credits: I have implemented the extra credits exercises, please test them for confirmation
