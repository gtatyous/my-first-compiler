Class  : CSE450
Project: 02
author : Yousef Gtat
gropu  : Yousef Gtat and Ian Bacus

Summary: All code was developed by the author (myself). I am part of a team, but since this project was fairly easy, we did not have to collaborate together.
         Basically, Ian should have completely different implementation than mine. We will be working on future projects together, however.
         ALL MY CODE WORKS. IT PASSED ALL TESTS INCLUDING EXTRA CREDITS TESTS.

Implementation:
         Using Flex for lexical analysis to create tokens which are sent to bison for parsing.
         Lex regex expressions are listed inside scanner.lex
         The syntax tree is defined by sets of rules provided inside myparser.y 
         multiple declarations are allowed in my syntax. Thus, extra credit tests were passed.


External Resources (if any):

Flex documentations
Bison documentations
regex.com used for checking my rules
my implementation follows the smae C++ Operator Precedence en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence
